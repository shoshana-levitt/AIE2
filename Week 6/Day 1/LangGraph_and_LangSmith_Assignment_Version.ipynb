        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

By using both together, RAG improves the quality of language models' generated responses by grounding the model on external sources of knowledge. It can help users check claims, clear up ambiguity, and reduce hallucination in their queries.\""

This extended range is ideal for applications that require communication over large geographic areas.\\n\\n2. Low Power Consumption: LoRa devices are designed to operate on low power, making them suitable for battery-operated devices. This low power consumption extends the battery life of IoT devices, reducing the need for frequent battery replacements.\\n\\n3. Low Cost: LoRa technology is cost-effective compared to other communication technologies, making it an attractive option for IoT deployments on a large scale. The infrastructure required for LoRa networks is relatively simple and inexpensive to deploy.\\n\\n4. Scalability: The LoRa system is highly scalable, allowing for the deployment of a large number of devices within a single network. This scalability makes it suitable for applications that require a high density of IoT devices, such as smart cities and industrial IoT.\\n\\n5. Secure Communication: LoRa technology provides secure communication through encryption and authentication mechanisms, ensuring that data transmitted between devices is protected from unauthorized access.\\n\\nOverall, the LoRa system offers significant improvements in terms of long-range communication, low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and security, making it a popular choice for IoT applications in various industries.',\n",

            "Tool Response: The attention mechanism is a technique used in machine learning and natural language processing to increase model accuracy by focusing on relevant data. It enables the model to focus on certain areas of the input data, giving more weight to crucial features and disregarding unimportant ones. The Machine learning-based attention method simulates how human attention works by assigning varying levels of importance to different words in a sentence. It assigns importance to each word by calculating \"soft\" weights for the word's numerical representation, known as its embedding, within a specific section of the sentence called the context window to determine its importance. 1. Introduction. Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning.

The concept of \"attention\" in deep learning has its roots in the effort to improve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for handling longer sequences or sentences.
