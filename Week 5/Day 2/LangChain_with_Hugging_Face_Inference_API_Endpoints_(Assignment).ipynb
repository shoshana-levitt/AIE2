Mitigating the performance degradation caused by weight quantization in LLM by fine-tuning additional adapters for downstream tasks, sometimes even yielding notable performance enhancements.\\n\\nIn summary, LoRA makes significant improvements in optimizing the loss function, augmenting a linear projection through an additional factorized projection, and mitigating the performance degradation caused by weight quantization in LLM.'}},\n",
